Description: Implementation the outbreak analysis method described by 
    Klinkenberg et al (2017) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005495>. 
    Simulate outbreaks, analyse datasets by creating samples from the 
    posterior distribution with a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo sampler, 
    and summarize the output. Adapted by Bastiaan van der Roest and Thi Mui Pham. Specifically, this branch allows the inclusion of the last negative test.
